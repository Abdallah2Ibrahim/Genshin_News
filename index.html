    <ul>
        <li> Weapons </li>
        <ul>
            <li>: Skyward Blade: This 5-star sword is excellent for Bennett due to its high base attack, energy recharge
                bonus, and its ability, "Eagle's Blade," which increases Bennett's CRIT Rate and provides an energy
                restoration effect.</li>
            <li> Aquila Favonia: Another powerful 5-star sword, Aquila Favonia grants Bennett a significant base attack
                increase and also provides an ATK bonus based on max HP. Additionally, its skill, "Falcon's Defiance,"
                increases Bennett's ATK and CRIT DMG.</li>
            <li> Favonius Sword: This 4-star sword is notable for its energy recharge substat and its ability,
                "Windfall," which has a chance to generate elemental particles upon a critical hit. It allows Bennett to
                charge his elemental burst more frequently.</li>
        </ul> <br><br>
        <li>The best artifact set is Noblesse Oblige: This 4-piece set is another excellent choice for Bennett,
            especially in a support role. It increases Bennett's Elemental Burst damage and grants an ATK bonus to the
            entire party for a short duration after using his Elemental Burst. It's great for boosting team damage in
            co-op play.</li>

        <li> Weapons </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Wolf's Gravestone: This 5-star claymore is widely considered the best weapon for Diluc. It provides a
                significant boost to base attack and increases the entire party's ATK when Diluc is on the field. Its
                ability, "Wolfish Tracker," further boosts Diluc's ATK and provides a damage bonus to enemies with less
                than 30% HP.</li>
            <li> Serpent Spine: This 4-star claymore is a strong option for Diluc. It increases base attack and grants
                an ATK bonus based on the number of hits taken. While it requires careful play to maintain its stacks,
                it can significantly increase Diluc's damage potential.</li>
            <li>Blackcliff Slasher: This 4-star claymore is a good choice if you want to focus on Diluc's critical
                damage. It increases base attack and grants a stacking ATK bonus upon defeating an enemy. It can be
                especially potent when combined with Diluc's high CRIT Rate.</li>
        </ul> <br><br>
        <li>The best artifact set is Crimson Witch of Flames: This 4-piece set is considered the go-to set for Diluc. It
            increases Pyro damage and boosts Overloaded and Burning damage. It synergizes perfectly with Diluc's pyro
            abilities and greatly enhances his overall damage output. </li>
